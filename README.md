**BULB**

Welcome to Bulb, we are a team consisting of:
* Burhan @Baalwaan
* Banna @Bantek89
* Freddie @Fweddie
* Sylvia @seabasshoang

## WHY
Our purpose was to tailor a website that is based on the user stories. The aim of this project was to make it accesible to all users of any technological ability, responsive to any device and compatible with or without javascript.

## WHAT 
We decided on making the site play a type on animation to reveal the name of our company then the text typer becomes the collapsable navigaton bar on the right hand side.
Then for our profiles section we wanted to let the user slide horizontally through the profiles instead of just vertically.

## HOW 
We split the work into the different page elements which were:
* Navigation bar
* Landing page
* Profiles section
* Submit form section

Throughout the project we pair programmed and set specific parts on the website to work on.  

## CHALLENGES
* Getting used to the git workflow as a team
* Working mobile first 
* CSS animations without the use of javascript
